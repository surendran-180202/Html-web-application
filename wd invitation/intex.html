				    <p>Perceiving that Ram was an orphan with none to even write to him, Vijayalakshmi asked everyone on the radio to send their love for Ram, with herself writing a letter to him addressing him as her son. As a result, Ram began to receive several letters while one of them from Sita Mahalakshmi fascinated him. Sita claimed that she was married to Ram and recollected several incidents of their marriage, that never happened. However, there was no sender's address on the letter leaving Ram unaware of who she was and how she looked. While receiving letters regularly from her, Ram figured it out that she would board a train to Hyderabad from Delhi through few details in one of her letters and boarded the same train with Vikas. He eventually found her and recognized her using a riddle she posed for him in a letter, gave her the replies he had written to her letters and left her compartment not before telling her to call the landline of his friend Durjoy Sharma of Hyderabad, with whom he would be staying for next few days. Ram and Vikas unintentionally boarded a train to Madras and hence, it took them some time to reach Hyderabad, where Ram was broken to realize that Durjoy's landline was dead and felt disappointed thinking that he could not meet Sita again. However, she arrived at Durjoy's house searching for Ram asking him to forget her but he refused and she left without telling him who she was. 
<br>Now, Vikas reveals to Afreen and Balaji that he could not meet Ram after that due to his personal problems and gives them Durjoy's address and Vishnu's contact. Afreen makes a phone call to Vishnu through an Telephone booth at a bus station but is compelled to disconnect the call as the bus to Hyderabad is about to leave. Curious that someone wants to know about Ram, Vishnu mysteriously postpones his plans to search for Afreen. The latter meets Durjoy and learns what happened after Sita left. 
<br>Ram and Durjoy went for a magic show, which Sita said she wanted Ram to take her to in one of her letters. They successfully managed to find Sita and Ram conversed with her friend Rekha, who disclosed that Sita was the Bharatanatyam teacher to Princess Noor Jahan. Ram and Sita began to spend time with each other and Ram eventually learnt that he rescued Sita from riots in Agarta, that's when she had fallen in love with his benevolent nature. Ram dared to fool the accountant Subramanyam to get into the palace and meet Sita, whom he proposed but she left yet again as something interrupted her from accepting the proposal. Currently, Durjoy gives Afreen and Balaji a photo of Sita, Ram clicked from his camera which Afreen takes to Subramanyam for him to identify her but realizes through a portrait in the palace that Sita is in fact Princess Noor Jahan. 
<br>Afreen and Balaji meet Rekha, who reveals that Noor was in love with Ram but her destiny prevented her from accepting him. As her family's assets in Oman were captured due to the financial crisis, her brother engineering a truce offering to get her married to the Prince of Oman. Rekha advised Noor to divulge about her identity to Ram and she intended to do it by accompanying him to his family, who wrote him letters. However, during those days, Noor felt attached to Ram and could not reveal her identity while left for Kashmir not before expecting Noor to go with him but she could not as the Prince of Oman accepted to marry her. while unbeknownst to them, a journalist Marthandam clicked their pictures and published them in the newspaper publicizing Noor Jahan's affair with a common man. When the Prince of Oman requested for an explanation from Noor through an ambassador, Noor's brother asked her to reveal that she had nothing to do with Ram but she imparted that she was in love with Ram and was ready to give her property up for him. She left for Kashmir despite receiving opposition from her brother and without passing on about her true identity, she spent a few days with Ram and got acquainted with his colleagues and superiors. </p>
